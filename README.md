# GitHub Actions Workflow: Basic Setup

## Overview

In this repository, we have implemented a **GitHub Actions workflow** to automate simple tasks as part of learning **Continuous Integration (CI)** principles. This serves as an introduction to setting up workflows for automating common development tasks, such as running scripts or tests, directly on GitHub.

---

## What We Have Done

1. **Created a GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Added a YAML file (`.github/workflows/basic.yml`) to define a workflow.
   - This workflow is triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

2. **Configured the Workflow Steps:**
   - **Checkout Code:** Used the `actions/checkout@v2` action to pull the repository code into the GitHub Actions runner environment.
   - **Echo Command:** Added a simple step to display a message ("Hello, GitHub Actions!") in the workflow log, demonstrating how commands are executed.

3. **Resolved Workflow Errors:**
   - Fixed YAML syntax issues to ensure the workflow is valid and runs successfully.
   - Validated the indentation and alignment of steps to meet YAML formatting requirements.

## Why We Did This

1. **To Learn CI Fundamentals:**
   - Understanding GitHub Actions is a key skill in modern software development workflows.
   - Automating repetitive tasks (like tests, builds, or deployments) improves efficiency and reliability.

2. **To Gain Hands-On Experience:**
   - By implementing this basic workflow, weâ€™ve learned how to:
     - Write and format YAML files for GitHub Actions.
     - Automate tasks triggered by Git events (e.g., pushing code).
     - Debug and resolve workflow errors effectively.

3. **To Build a Foundation for Advanced Workflows:**
   - This basic setup lays the groundwork for more complex workflows, such as running linting tools, executing tests, or deploying applications.

## How It Works

1. **Trigger:**
   - The workflow is triggered by any push event to the `main` branch.

2. **Steps:**
   - **Checkout Code:** Pulls the latest code from the repository into the GitHub Actions runner.
   - **Echo Command:** Prints a simple message in the workflow logs as a demonstration of command execution.

## Key Files

- **Workflow File:** `.github/workflows/basic.yml`
  - Contains the workflow definition in YAML format.

## Future Enhancements

This basic setup can be extended in future projects to:
- Automate linting or testing processes.
- Deploy applications to cloud environments.
- Integrate advanced CI/CD pipelines.

## Sample Workflow Output

- **Trigger Event:** A push to the `main` branch.
- **Expected Output:** A message in the GitHub Actions log:
